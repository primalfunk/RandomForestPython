# RandomForestPython
Using the ensemble learning method known as Random Forest for a classic business problem - churn prediction.

I'll log my progress through this. For some of it, I'm seeing for the very first time.

Setup:
1) create the git repo (done here)
2) create the virtual environment in VS Code terminal; python -m venv venv
3) activate the virtual env: ./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
4) install modules (pip)

I'm organized into 4 classes; the Spoofer (numpy), the Preprocessing (sci-kit learn & pandas), the Model (sci-kit learn), and the Visualization (matplotlib and seaborn).
